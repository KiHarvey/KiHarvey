Greetings. In the event that you have stumbled across my GitHub page, I apologize for the haphazard collection of school projects.
Up until recently I was working full time in the pharmacy field and pursuing a bachelor's in computer science, so I have yet to dedicate my efforts to making this
area very cohesive.
